The moon was a drip on a dark hood
'N they were drivin' around 'n around
Vital Willy tol' Weepin' Milly
I'm gonna booglarize you baby
I'm gonna booglarize you baby
If I can find ah place t' park my machine
Out ah town
Milly tol' Willy come on over t'my house
I'll slow your machine right down
'Cause listen Vitals gives me the Willies
Drivin' around 'n around
Drivin' around n' around
If you keep beatin' around the bush
You'll lose your push
If you keep beatin' around the bush
You'll lose your push
The moon was ah drip on ah dark hood
The moon was ah drip on ah dark hood
'N they were drivin' around 'n around
Tush tush
Bogota boogie
Tush tush
Bogota boogie around
There ain't no place t' stop around
Bogota boogie said Weepin' Milly
Now Willy come over t' my place
'N I'll slow you right down
You lose your push tush
When you beat around the bush
If you act reserved
I know somebody payin' for your parkin' place
You gotta take your space
Tush tush
You lose your push
When you beat around
When you beat around
When you beat around the bush
Bogota boogie
Bogota boogie
I'm gonna booglarize you baby

She serves me flowers 'n' yams
'N in the night when I'm full
She brings me white jam
'N I don't know where I am
In the meadow she brings me
Like ah bee she stings me
'N I don't know where I am
Clouds clingin' to us
'N the sun lookin' through us
'N in the night when I'm full
She brings me white jam
'N I don't know where I am

When it blows its stacks
He ain't nowhere to be found
When ah wolf's claws wear way down
Better watch out there's ah man eater around
Hide all the women in town
When it blows its stacks
All you girls make no mistake
He's as cold as ah snake sleepin' in the shade
He takes um out
Out on an iceberg
Hand 'em ah Ronson 'n says
I'll see you around
When he straighten up
They all bend down
He don't bow to bad water
He don't pussy foot around
When it blows its stacks
He ain't nowhere to be found

Said the momma to the baby in the corn
You are my first born
You shall here on in be known as the spotlight kid
'N the mornin' cry of the rooster
The baby lay alone
'N the old cow in the green grass
Shed white tears in the red hot sun
'N the spotlight kid stood under the moon that evenin'
Givin' her alibis 'n eatin' her a la modes
'N the ice cream man searchin' high 'n low
For his a la modes foe his a la modes
'N the green frogs croakin' around his abode
'N the mud cat pond by the old willow road
All night the village waited 'n the spotlight kid never showed
She was up on the mountain
Tellin' her alibis 'n eatin' her a la modes
Momma still knew she was the one
She was the one who stole the pie from old Momma Eye
Window bare rockin' chair groanin' like ah grizzly bear
'N the ice cream man searchin' high 'n low
For his a la modes for his a la modes
All night the village waited 'n the spotlight kid never showed
She was up on the mountain tellin' her alibis
'N eatin' her a la modes

Two trains
Two railroad tracks
One goin' 'n the other one comin' back
There goes my baby on that ole train

I say come back come back baby come back
Click clack click clack
There's my baby wain' her handkerchief down
My cars stand up when I hear that sound

This time it sound like it's for keeps
Click clack click clack
I get down on the ground
With the gravel around

I pray to the Lord
That the train will stop
Turn right around
'N never stop till it drop my baby off

Now I had this girl
Threatened 'n leave me all the time
Maybe you had uh girl like that
I-yuh all time cryin'

Well I had this girl
Threatened 'n leave me all the time
Threatenin' to go down to N'Orleans-uh
'N get herself lost 'n found

Maybe you had uh girl like this
She's always threatenin' to go down to N'Orleans
'N get herself lost 'n found
C'mon I'll play it for yuh

Lemme tell yuh 'bout it
Lemme tell yuh 'bout it
There were two railroad tracks
Click clack click clack

One ah them leavin'-uh
'N the other one comin' back
I was two years from yuh baby
You were goin' way up the tracks

The train was leavin'-uh
I could see yuh wavin' your handkerchief

Now here ya come baby
With yer tail draggin' the gravy
Y' know yer P's 'n Q's
What ya don't know baby
Is you givin' me the blues
Ya got juice on your chin
Eggs on the drain-board
Pie on the wall
Dirt on the rug
I come home late
'N I stumbled 'n swore
Ya won't even give me a hug
Ya had my things all laid out by the door
I'm leavin'
I'm gonna take up with ah mermaid
'N leave you land lubbin' women alone
'N leave you land lubbin' women alone
Ya said ya had it together once
Now yer head's around the bend
I'm tellin' ya woman
Ya better get it bach together again

'N go back in the water again
If ya don't leave me alone

Now here ya come baby
With yer tail draggin' the gravy
Ya know yer P's 'n Q's

There ain't no Santa Claus on the evenin' stage
There ain't no way t' pull the curtain
'N hide from hunger's rage
There ain't no town t' stop in
There ain't no time t' stop in
There ain't no straw for my horse
There ain't no straw for my bed
There ain't no comfort in cold boards
There ain't no rumours or food for my stomach
'N someday I'm gonna be saved
'Cause I gotta eat 'n' drink 'n' breathe 'n' sleep
'N I'm ah slave
Down in hominy's grotto there's ah soul die'n 'n leavin'
Every second on the evenin' stage
There's ah soul die'n 'n rottin' 'n' pickin'
Some new kinda cotton
With his fingers broken 'n' his heart 'n' back forgotten
There ain't no Santa Claus on the evenin' stage

Into the sun in my glider
There's a shadow beside her
Up 'n down through the blues
Clouds give me my silent cues
I'm up in my glider
With a shadow beside her
It begins to rain on her window pain
Up in my glider
There's no shadow beside her
Thundering 'n lightning
Gettin' pretty frightenin'
I feel like an outsider
Then the sun shows through 'n right on cue
There's a shadow beside her
Up 'n down through the blues
I'm up in my glider
'N I'm telling you boys there ain't no noise
'N me and my baby ain't never gonna bring my glider down

Apes-ma, apes-ma
Your cage is too dirty, apes-ma
Remember when you were young, apes-ma?
And you used to break out of your cage?
Well you know that you're not
Strong enough to do that anymore now
And apes-ma, the little girl that
Named you years ago has died now
And you're older, apes-ma
Remember when she named you
And it was in the paper, apes-ma?
Apes-ma, apes-ma
You're eating too much
And going to the bathroom too much, apes-ma
And apes-ma
Your cage isn't getting any bigger, apes-ma

Bat chain
Puller
Bat chain puller
Puller, puller

A chain with yellow lights
That glistens like oil beads
On its slick smooth trunk
That trails behind on tracks, and thumps
A wing hangs limp and retreats

Bat chain puller
Puller puller

Bulbs shoot from its snoot
And vanish into darkness
It whistles like a root snatched from dry earth
Sodbustin' rakes with grey dust claws
Announces it's coming in the morning
This train with grey tubes
That houses people's very thoughts and belongings

Bat chain puller
Puller puller

This train with grey tubes that houses people's thoughts
Their very remains and belongings
A grey cloth patch
Caught with four threads
In the hollow wind of its stacks
Ripples felt fades and grey sparks clacks
Lunging the cushioned thickets
Pumpkins span the hills
With orange Crayola patches
Green inflated trees
Balloon up into marshmallow soot
That walks away in faulty circles
Caught in grey blisters
With twinkling lights and green sashes
Drawn by rubber dolphins with gold yawning mouths
That blister and break in agony
In zones of rust
They gild gold sawdust into dust

Bat chain puller
Puller puller
